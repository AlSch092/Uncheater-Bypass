# Uncheater Bypass

Uncheater is a home-rolled anti-cheat made by WEMADE and used in their Unreal Engine games such as MIR4. At first glance it appears to be some crooked/lite version of XIGNCODE3, but essentially it's just a bunch of WINAPI calls (with server auth.), and leads to a ton of false positives/bans. You may be banned for having certain processes open in the background but not in any way related to their game, resulting in a ton of time and effort wasted playing.
